# AQA GCE A-Level-Computer-Science
A code repository for AQA GCE A-Level Computer Science. This repository is intended as a place for Computer Science teachers to collaborate and share examples of good coding and practice.

This repository was initially created by a Design Teacher that defected to Computer Science. He is not a Computer Science speicalist (yet), so please be kind!
